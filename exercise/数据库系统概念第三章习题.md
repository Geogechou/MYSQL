### 3.11 

(a)

```mysql
select distinct name from student natural join
	takes natural join course 
	where course.dept_name='Comp. Sci.';
```

(b)

mysql不支持except，所以用not in 代替

```mysql
select ID,name from student where student.ID 
not in 
(select student.ID from student natural join takes where year<2009);
```

(c)

```mysql
select dept_name,max(salary) as top_salary from instructor group by dept_name;
```

(d)

```mysql
with top(dept_name,top_salary) as 
	(select dept_name,max(salary) as top_salary from instructor group by dept_name)
    select min(top_salary) from top;
```

### 3.12

(a)

```mysql
insert into course value('CS-001','Weekly Seminar','Comp. Sci.',0);
```

(b)

```mysql
insert into section(course_id,sec_id,semester,year) value('CS-001',1,'Fall',2009);
```

(c)

```mysql
insert into takes(ID,course_id,sec_id,semester,year)
	select ID,'CS-001','1','Fall',2009 from student where dept_name='Comp. Sci.';
```

(d)

```mysql
delete from takes where course_id='CS-001' and sec_id='1' and semester='Fall' and year=2009 
and ID in (select ID from student where name='Chavez');
```

(e)

```mysql
delete from course where course_id='CS-001';
```

如果没有设置级联删除，由于course_id是section的外键，会导致删除失败。设置级联删除之后，会把所有依赖于course_id='CS-001'的元祖全部删掉。

(f)

在MySQL中，直接在表中查出再删除不被允许，因此，创建一张临时表tmp

```mysql
delete from takes where ID in 
(
	select ID from(
		select ID from takes natural join course where lower(title) like '%database%'
	) tmp
);
```

### 3.15

(a)

```mysql
with branchcount as 
(
	select count(1) from Branch where branch_city='Brooklyn'
)
select custumer_name from customer c
where branchcount =
(select count(distinct branch_name) from (customer natural join depositor natural join account natural join branch) as d where d.customer_name = c.customer_name);
```



(b)

```mysql
select sum(amount) from loan;
```

(c)

```mysql
select branch_name from branch where 
assets > (select min(assets) from branch where branch_city='Brooklyn');
```

### 3.17

(a)

```mysql
update works set salary = salary*1.1 where company_name='First Bank Corporation';
```

(b)

```mysql
update works set salary = salary*1.1 where employee_name in (select manager_name from managers where company_name='First Bank Corporation');
```

(c)

```mysql
delete from works where company_name='Small Bank Corporation';
```

### 3.24



```mysql
select dept_name from 
(select sum(salary) as val,dept_name from instructor group by dept_name) as T(val,dept_name)
where T.val >=
(select avg(val) from 
 (select sum(salary) as val from instructor group by dept_name) as T(val)
);

```
